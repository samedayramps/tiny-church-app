Row-Level Security (RLS) Configuration for Your Supabase App

RLS ensures that users can only access the data they are authorized to see. For your app, you’ll configure RLS policies for key tables (members, help_tickets, etc.) to ensure appropriate data access based on user roles and relationships.

General Steps for Setting Up RLS

	1.	Enable RLS for Each Table:
	•	Go to the Table Editor in the Supabase dashboard.
	•	Select a table (e.g., members).
	•	Click Enable RLS.
	2.	Create RLS Policies:
	•	Use SQL to define policies that specify who can access or modify rows in each table.
	•	Add these policies in the Policies tab for each table.

RLS Policies for Your Tables

1. Members Table

	•	Goal: Allow users to access only their own member profile.
	•	Policy:

CREATE POLICY "Allow individual access to own profile"
ON members
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = id);


	•	Explanation:
	•	auth.uid() returns the unique ID of the authenticated user.
	•	This policy ensures users can only view their own data.
	•	Optional Policy for Admins:
Allow admins to access all member profiles.

CREATE POLICY "Allow admin access to all profiles"
ON members
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.role() = 'admin');

2. Help Tickets Table

	•	Goal: Allow users to access and update only their own tickets.
	•	Policies:
	•	Select (Read) Policy:

CREATE POLICY "Allow individual access to own tickets"
ON help_tickets
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);


	•	Insert Policy:

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to create tickets"
ON help_tickets
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);


	•	Update Policy:
Allow users to update their own tickets.

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update own tickets"
ON help_tickets
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);


	•	Admin Policy:
Allow admins to update and manage all tickets.

CREATE POLICY "Allow admin access to all tickets"
ON help_tickets
FOR ALL
USING (auth.role() = 'admin');

3. Events Table

	•	Goal: Allow users to see events linked to their groups.
	•	Policy:

CREATE POLICY "Allow group-based access to events"
ON events
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() IN (
  SELECT member_id
  FROM member_groups
  WHERE group_id = ANY(group_ids)
));


	•	Explanation:
	•	This policy checks if the authenticated user is part of any group associated with the event (group_ids).
	•	Admin Policy:
Allow admins to access all events.

CREATE POLICY "Allow admin access to all events"
ON events
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.role() = 'admin');

4. Event Attendees Table

	•	Goal: Allow users to manage their RSVP status for events.
	•	Policies:
	•	Select Policy:

CREATE POLICY "Allow access to own RSVP data"
ON event_attendees
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = member_id);


	•	Insert/Update Policy:

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to RSVP for events"
ON event_attendees
FOR INSERT, UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = member_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = member_id);

5. Feedback Table

	•	Goal: Allow users to view and submit their own feedback.
	•	Policies:
	•	Select Policy:

CREATE POLICY "Allow access to own feedback"
ON feedback
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = member_id);


	•	Insert Policy:

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to submit feedback"
ON feedback
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = member_id);

Testing RLS Policies

	1.	Test in Supabase SQL Editor:
	•	Use Supabase’s SQL Editor to simulate queries as different users.
	•	Example: Simulate as a specific user with their uid:

SET LOCAL ROLE 'user';
SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims" = '{"sub": "user-id"}';
SELECT * FROM members;


	2.	Check Logs:
	•	Monitor the Supabase logs to see which policies are being applied to queries.

Optional: Role-Based Permissions

If your platform has roles (e.g., admin, user), implement role-based policies:

Example: Assign Roles in Supabase Auth

	•	Use app_metadata or custom_claims in Supabase Auth to store roles (e.g., admin, user).

Example Policy Using Roles

	•	Allow admins to bypass RLS restrictions:

CREATE POLICY "Admin bypass"
ON members
FOR ALL
USING (auth.role() = 'admin');

Next Steps

	1.	Enable RLS:
	•	Ensure RLS is enabled on all sensitive tables.
	2.	Test Policies:
	•	Verify that only authorized users can access specific rows.
	3.	Integrate with Your App:
	•	Use the auth.uid() function in queries to fetch data specific to the logged-in user.
